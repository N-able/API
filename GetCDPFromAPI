# Generate a pseudo-unique namespace to use with the New-WebServiceProxy and 
# associated types.
#
# By controlling the namespace, the script becomes portable and is not
# dependent upon the endpoint url the webservice is connecting.  However, this
# introduces another complexity because once the namespace is defined within a
# powershell session, it cannot be reused, nor can it be undefined.  As long as
# all the calls are made to the existing webserviceproxy, then everything would be
# OK. But, if you try to rerun the script without closing and reopening the
# powershell session, you will get an error.
#
# One way around this is to create a unique namespace each time the script is run.
# We do this by using the last 'word' of a GUID appended to our base namespace 'NAble'.
# This means our type names for parameters (such as T_KeyPair) now have a dynamic
# type.  We could pass types to each new-object call using "$NWSNameSpace.T_KeyPair",
# and I find it more readable to define our 'dynamic' types here and use the typenames
# in variables when calling New-Object.
#
